# Contributing to H.A.R.B.O.R.

Welcome to the H.A.R.B.O.R. (Human Analytics, Research, Business Operations, Research) ecosystem! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our sailing-themed data exploration platform.

## üåä About H.A.R.B.O.R.

H.A.R.B.O.R. is a comprehensive ecosystem for graph database exploration and visualization, designed to provide intuitive navigation through complex data structures. The project consists of several core applications and supporting tools that work together to make data exploration accessible to everyone.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

H.A.R.B.O.R. is structured around three distinct layers:

### **Breakwater** üõ°Ô∏è
*Core Foundation and Protection*

The Breakwater layer houses the core intellectual property - the fundamental components that provide the foundation for all other tools. This is where the "secret sauce" lives, protected and stable.

**Contents:**
- Core H.A.R.B.O.R. components
- Fundamental algorithms
- Base frameworks
- Intellectual property

### **Lighthouse** üóº
*Business Operations and Guidance*

The Lighthouse layer provides guidance and operational tools for the business. This is where the team works to improve core elements, build strategy, and keep the business running smoothly.

**Contents:**
- Business tools and dashboards
- Internal applications
- R&D projects
- Operational systems

### **Marina** ‚õµ
*Personal and Client Projects*

The Marina layer provides individual spaces for personal projects, client work, and experimental features. This is the innovation zone where new ideas can be tested and developed.

**Contents:**
- Personal sandboxes
- Client interfaces
- Experimental features
- Community contributions

## üö¢ Core Applications

### **Beacon** üî¶
*Graph Database Visualization and Pattern Detection*

Beacon provides an intuitive interface for exploring Neo4j graph databases through pattern recognition and interactive visualizations.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive graph visualization
- Pattern detection and analysis
- Database connection management

- Custom pattern library

### **Harbor Explorer** üß≠
*Interactive Graph Navigation and Exploration*

Harbor Explorer offers a comprehensive interface for navigating graph data through multiple exploration patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Dual navigation modes (structured and free-form)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Schema exploration tools
- Custom query interface
- Export and sharing capabilities

### **ChartOne** üìä
*Cognitive-Aligned Reading Interface*

ChartOne represents a breakthrough in digital reading technology, presenting text as a continuous horizontal flow.

**Key Features:**

## üõ†Ô∏è Supporting Tools

### **CodeAnchor** ‚öì
*Code Generation and Analysis Framework*

CodeAnchor serves as the foundational anchor for code generation within the H.A.R.B.O.R. ecosystem.

### **DataRigging** üé£
*Data Exploration and Visualization Toolkit*

DataRigging provides sophisticated data exploration and visualization capabilities.

## üß† Development Philosophy

H.A.R.B.O.R. operates on the principle that **technology should adapt to human exploration patterns, not the other way around**. We focus on:

- **Cognitive Alignment**: Interfaces that match natural thinking patterns
