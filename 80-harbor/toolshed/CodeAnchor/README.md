# CodeAnchor âš“

**Code Generation and Analysis Framework**

CodeAnchor serves as the foundational anchor for code generation within the H.A.R.B.O.R. (Human Analytics, Research, Business Operations, Research) ecosystem. It provides a stable foundation for generating, analyzing, and maintaining code across multiple languages and frameworks.

## Overview

CodeAnchor serves as the foundational anchor for code generation within the H.A.R.B.O.R. ecosystem. It provides a stable foundation for generating, analyzing, and maintaining code across multiple languages and frameworks.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Intelligent Code Generation**: Generate code based on patterns, templates, and specifications
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and apply common coding patterns
- **Multi-language Support**: Generate code in multiple programming languages
- **Template System**: Flexible template-based code generation
- **Code Analysis**: Analyze existing code for patterns and improvements
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generate documentation from code

### Sailing Metaphor Integration

CodeAnchor embraces the sailing theme with features like:

- **Anchoring**: Stable code generation with consistent patterns
- **Navigation**: Guided code generation with clear direction
- **Charts**: Code templates and patterns as navigational charts
- **Compass**: Directional guidance for code structure and organization

## Usage

### Basic Code Generation

```python
from codeseed import CodeAnchor

# Create a new code anchor instance
anchor = CodeAnchor()

# Generate code from template
code = anchor.generate(
    template="class_template",
    language="python",
    parameters={
        "class_name": "MyClass",
        "attributes": ["name", "value"],
        "methods": ["get_name", "set_value"]
    }
)
```

### Pattern Recognition

```python
# Analyze existing code for patterns
patterns = anchor.analyze_patterns("path/to/code")

# Apply recognized patterns to new code
generated_code = anchor.apply_patterns(patterns, "new_feature")
```

## Configuration

CodeAnchor can be configured through various methods:

### Environment Variables

```bash
export CODEANCHOR_TEMPLATE_DIR="/path/to/templates"
export CODEANCHOR_OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/output"
export CODEANCHOR_LANGUAGE="python"
```

### Configuration File

```yaml
# config.yaml
templates:
  directory: "/path/to/templates"
  default_language: "python"
  
output:
  directory: "/path/to/output"
  format: "structured"
  
patterns:
  recognition: true
  auto_apply: false
```

## Integration with H.A.R.B.O.R.

CodeAnchor integrates seamlessly with other H.A.R.B.O.R. components:

- **Beacon**: Provides code generation for graph database interfaces
- **Harbor Explorer**: Generates exploration and visualization code
- **DataRigging**: Creates data processing and transformation code
- **ChartOne**: Generates reading and navigation interface code
