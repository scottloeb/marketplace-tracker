## 📊 Google Sheets Queue Structure

Your queue sheet will automatically populate with this data:

| timestamp | When item was captured |
| url | Original marketplace URL |
| title | Listing title |
| price | Price (numbers only) |
| location | City, state, or region |
| marketplace | Source platform |
| status | Processing status (queued/processing/completed/failed) |
| error_msg | Error details if processing fails |
| photos | JSON array of image URLs |

## 🔄 Integration with Your Processing Pipeline

The extension creates a **perfect queue** for your existing automation:

```
Extension → Google Sheets Queue → Your Python Scripts → Supabase → Main App
```

Your existing `40-automation/` scripts can easily read from the Google Sheets queue:

```python
import gspread

# Read queue
gc = gspread.service_account()
sheet = gc.open("Marketplace Tracker Queue").sheet1
queued_items = sheet.get_all_records()

# Process items with status = 'queued'
for item in queued_items:
    if item['status'] == 'queued':
        # Run your existing enhancement pipeline
        enhanced_data = enhance_listing_data(item)
        save_to_supabase(enhanced_data)
        # Mark as completed in sheets
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting
