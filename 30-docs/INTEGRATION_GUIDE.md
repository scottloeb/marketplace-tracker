{
  "title": "2020 Yamaha VX Cruiser HO - 28 hours",
  "price": 9500,
  "market_analysis": {
    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "reason": "$9,500 is 25% below expected $12,700",
    "potential_savings": 3200,
    "msrp": 18500,
    "expected_price": 12700
  }
}

### Reference Data Enhancement
Each listing gets enhanced with:

- ✅ **Reference specifications** (HP, engine type, etc.)
- ✅ **Original MSRP** for price validation
- ✅ **Expected depreciation** based on age
- ✅ **Market recommendation** (BUY/CONSIDER/PASS/RESEARCH)

### Deal Detection
The system automatically flags:
- 🔥 **Underpriced** (25%+ below expected): "BUY" recommendation
- 💰 **Good deals** (10-25% below): "CONSIDER" recommendation  
- 📊 **Fair pricing** (±10% of expected): "RESEARCH" recommendation
- ⚠️ **Overpriced** (20%+ above expected): "PASS" recommendation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No listings found"
**Cause**: Facebook changed page structure or requires login
**Solution**: 
```bash
python browser_scraper.py "URL" --no-headless
# This shows the browser so you can handle login manually
```

#### 2. "Import failed in tracker"
**Cause**: JSON format mismatch
**Solution**: 
- Check that `extracted_listings.json` has the correct structure
- Use `test_extraction.json` to verify import functionality first

#### 3. "Reference data not found"
**Cause**: CSV file path issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify reference file exists
ls -la /workspace/reference/jet_ski_specs_main.csv
```

#### 4. "Browser won't start"
**Cause**: Missing Playwright browser
**Solution**:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug output
python browser_scraper.py "URL" --no-headless --max-listings 5

# Check generated data
python -m json.tool extracted_listings.json | head -50
```
