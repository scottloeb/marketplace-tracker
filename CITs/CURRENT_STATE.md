## Recent Accomplishments
1. **Data Extraction**: 166 Facebook listings extracted with real prices ($150-$25,000 range)
2. **Market Analysis**: Average $9,659, identified 4 statistical outliers for potential deals
3. **Mobile Integration**: Created queue system for phone-to-tracker URL submission
4. **Missing Info Detector**: Analyzes listings and suggests seller questions
5. **Repository Organization**: Semantic numbering system implemented

## Pending Tasks
1. **Integration**: Add mobile-queue.js to index.html
2. **Deployment**: Push to GitHub and update Vercel deployment
3. **Testing**: Verify mobile queue functionality at https://ski-shopper.vercel.app/
4. **Documentation**: Update project instructions and README files

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Single HTML file with zero build dependencies
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts with Playwright for Facebook extraction
- **Mobile Workflow**: Queue-based URL submission system
- **Duplicate Handling**: URL-based deduplication with manual review queue
- **Storage**: Local JSON files + localStorage for queue management

## Core Features Working
- Facebook Marketplace URL extraction with price detection
- Market analysis with statistical outlier detection
- Mobile queue for phone-to-tracker workflow
- Missing information analysis for seller questions
- Export functionality for Ocean Explorer integration

## Next Session Priorities
1. Complete index.html integration with mobile queue
2. Run comprehensive cleanup script
3. Deploy to GitHub and Vercel
4. Test mobile functionality end-to-end

## Commands to Resume
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/marketplace-tracker
chmod +x comprehensive_cleanup.sh
./comprehensive_cleanup.sh
```

## Critical Context
- All 166 extracted listings have real pricing data (no longer showing Facebook page titles)
- Mobile queue system ready for phone URL submissions
- Missing info detector identifies gaps in listing details and suggests seller questions
- Repository is deployment-ready with proper semantic organization
