## üìù **Notes Section**
*(Quick thoughts, links, inspiration, etc.)*

I think of this almost like a travel planner - the decisions are complex, and choosing one option can impact the other elements of the decision (like if you pick a super expensive hotel, you don't want to spend as much on a flight, or if you rent an RV, you have a ton of money to spend on the travel... or maybe you decide "let's go all out" and spend beyond your means)

Any kind of cutoff is going to mask fringe deals.  Maybe today i'm willing to spend $5000 but tomorrow $10000.  maybe speed is important this week but durability next week.  

On the similar note, I should be able to set filters and flexible limits.  price can be filtered on a slider (or absolute values).  user star rating on a star scale (min or max can be adjusted).  distance to me is important, but maybe i'm travelling to ohio next week and i want to adjust the locale, or i can flex on distance to home.

I think if there's a data element, there should be a matching filter / multi-select / slider / range / sort.

it'd be cool to see all of this on a map, with clusters and color coded listings that show more detail when you click.  this would be a great way to show the analysis results (via color codes) without prescribing an action.  the map can be filtered based on all of the data element filters.

I think we should see clusters - i can think of location clusters, but maybe there are other clusters we can use.

i'd love to be able to see stock photos alongside listing photos and videos.  but I'd want to differentiate between stock and real - so that I don't make decisions with an expectation of pristine new condition.

I want to be able to add notes on my phone or laptop and have them persist.  maybe i notice something on a site visit, or I am worried about something, or i reached out to the owner and added detail.  It'd be ideal if we can capture information from the notes to build out the dataset, but not always necessary.  maybe there can be a manual update to data fields if i get more info.  of course, these should be timestamped

We don't want to automatically exclude things based on arbitrary cutoffs.  for example, maybe a listing doesn't meet the criteria, but the lister simply wrote "clean title" in the description.  maybe getting more information from him reveals that it's actually a great deal!  So we'll want to take the information given (and what's missing) to come up with critical questions to answer on a per-listing basis.  this will help to uncover diamonds that look like coal in an efficient and friendly way.

google maps api?  other apis?

some things to keep in mind: 
yamahas are usually used for rentals.
check the market intel report we created because some of the technology advancements make a big difference.
i'll be using this in saltwater... closed loop cooling is pretty important!
some folks tune their enginers to get better performance.  what does that do for longevity?  what does it do to change value?

also really want to be able to view and filter and sort all of this stuff on my phone.  processing on my laptop i get, but if i have 5 minutes and i'm not near my laptop, i might want to look for "kawasaki's and sea doo's with 280+hp and tuned engines that are 20miles from my current location" (or something like that.

i don't think map view is the only way to look at this... but its the one I can think of right now. clusters by color?  feature?  tech?  i dunno.
