git commit -m "feat: implement semantic numbering system and full Harbor mirror

✨ Major repository reorganization and enhancement:

🔢 Semantic Numbering System:
- Renamed all folders with logical numbering (10-src, 20-reference, etc.)
- Follows CS best practices for scalable project organization
- Updated index.html paths for new numbered structure
- Created numbering convention documentation

🏗️ Harbor Integration:
- Implemented full Harbor repository mirror (one-way sync)
- Created sync-harbor.py for complete Harbor mirroring
- Tracks Harbor git info (branch: main, commit: f5445ac8)
- Preserves marketplace-tracker README customizations

📝 Dynamic README System:
- Auto-generates main README with folder structure table
- Validates all folder READMEs ≤50 words
- Creates dynamic linking between main and folder docs
- update-readmes.py script for maintenance automation

🎯 Zero Dependencies Maintained:
- Core application (10-src/) has no external dependencies
- External libs loaded via CDN (Supabase, Chart.js, D3.js)
- Harbor reference is static files only
- Minimal Python deps only where needed

📁 New Repository Structure:
10-src/      → Core application code
20-reference/ → Data and specifications  
30-docs/     → Documentation
40-automation/ → Tools and automation
50-scripts/  → Maintenance scripts
60-assets/   → Static assets
70-guides/   → User guides
80-harbor/   → Harbor repository mirror

✅ All systems tested and validated
🚀 Ready for Vercel deployment"
